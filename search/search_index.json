Options considered \u00b6 To generate custom resource (definitions) and controller stub code, we investigated a number of options: home-grown custom code generator kudo kubebuilder a hybrid custom code generator + sigs.kubernetes.io/controller-tools (CR) The original AWS Service Operator used a custom-built generator that processed YAML manifests describing the AWS service and used templates to generate CRDs , the controller code itself and the Go types that represent the CRDs in memory. It's worth noting that the CRDs and the controller code that was generated by the original ASO was very tightly coupled to CloudFormation. In fact, the CRDs for individual AWS services like S3 or RDS were thin wrappers around CloudFormation stacks that described the object being operated upon. kudo is a platform for building Kubernetes Operators. It stores state in its own kudo.dev CRDs and allows users to define \"plans\" for a deployed application to deploy itself. We determined that kudo was not a particularly good fit for ASO for a couple reasons. First, we needed a way to generate CRDs in several API groups (s3.aws.com and iam.aws.com for example) and the ACK controller code isn't deploying an \"application\" that needs to have a controlled deployment plan. Instead, ACK is a collection of controllers that facilitates creation and management of various AWS service objects using Kubernetes CRD instances. kubebuilder is the recommended upstream tool for generating CRDs and controller stub code. It is a Go binary that creates the scaffolding for CRDs and controller Go code. It has support for multiple API groups (e.g. s3.amazonaws.com and dynamodb.amazonaws.com ) in a single code repository, so allows for sensible separation of code. Our final option was to build a hybrid custom code generator that used controller-runtime under the hood but allowed us to generate controller stub code for multiple API groups and place generated code in directories that represented Go best practices. This option gives us the flexibility to generate the files and content for multiple API groups but still stay within the recommended guardrails of the upstream Kubernetes community. Our approach \u00b6 We ended up with a hybrid custom+controller-runtime, using multiple phases of code generation: The first code generation phase consumes model information from a canonical source of truth about an AWS service and the objects and interfaces that service exposes and generates files containing code that exposes Go types for those objects. These \"type files\" should be annotated with the marker and comments that will allow the core code generators and controller-gen to do its work. We will use the model files from the aws-sdk-go source repository as our source of truth and use the aws-sdk-go/private/model/api Go package to navigate that model. Note This step is the ack-generate apis command. After generating Kubernetes API type definitions for the top-level resources exposed by the AWS API, we then need to generate the \"DeepCopy\" interface implementations that enable those top-level resources and type definitions to be used by the Kubernetes runtime package (it defines an interface called runtime.Object that requires certain methods that copy the object and its component parts). Note This step runs the controller-gen object command Next, we generate the custom resource definition (CRD) configuration files, one for each top-level resource identified in earlier steps. Note This step runs the controller-gen crd command Next, we generate the actual implementation of the ACK controller for the target service. This step uses a set of templates and code in the pkg/model Go package to construct the service-specific resource management and linkage with the aws-sdk-go client for the service. Along with these controller implementation Go files, this step also outputs a set of Kubernetes configuration files for the Deployment and the ClusterRoleBinding of the Role created in the next step. Note This step runs the ack-generate controller command Finally, we generate the configuration file for a Kubernetes Role that the Kubernetes Pod (running in a Kubernetes Deployment ) running the ACK service controller.

Select a release from the list of releases for AWS Controllers for Kubernetes. You will see a list of Assets for the release. One of those Assets will be named services/$SERVICE_ALIAS/all-resources.yaml . For example, for the AWS S3 service controller, there will be an Asset named services/s3/all-resources.yaml attached to the release. Click on the link to download the YAML file. This YAML file may be fed to kubectl apply -f directly to install the service controller, any CRDs that it manages, and all necessary Kubernetes RBAC manifests. For example: 1 kubectl apply -f https://github.com/aws/aws-controllers-k8s/releases/download/v0.0.1/services/s3/all-resources.yaml Once you've installed one or more ACKs, make sure to configure permissions , next.","title":"Static Kubernetes manifests"},{"location":"user-docs/permissions/","text":"Configure permissions \u00b6 Because ACK bridges the Kubernetes and AWS APIs, before using ACK service controllers, you will need to do some initial configuration around Kubernetes and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. Configuring Kubernetes RBAC \u00b6 As part of installation, certain Kubernetes Role objects will be created that contain permissions to modify the Kubernetes custom resource (CR) objects that the ACK service controller is responsible for. NOTE : All Kubernetes CR objects managed by an ACK service controller are Namespaced objects; that is, there are no cluster-scoped ACK-managed CRs. By default, the following Kubernetes Role objects are created when installing an ACK service controller: ack.user : a Role used for reading and mutating namespace-scoped custom resource (CR) objects that the service controller manages. ack.reader : a Role used for reading namespaced-scoped custom resource (CR) objects that the service controller manages. When installing a service controller, if the Role already exists (because an ACK controller for a different AWS service has previously been installed), permissions to manage CRD and CR objects associated with the installed controller's AWS service are added to the existing Role . For example, if you installed the ACK service controller for AWS S3, during that installation process, the ack.user Role would have been granted read/write permissions to create CRs with a GroupKind of s3.services.k8s.aws/Bucket within a specific Kubernetes Namespace . Likewise the ack.reader Role would be been granted read permissions to view CRs with a GroupKind of s3.services.k8s.aws . If you later installed the ACK service controller for AWS SNS, the installation process would have added permissions to the ack.user Role to read/write CR objects of GroupKind sns.services.k8s.aws/Topic and added permissions to the ack.user Role to read CR objects of GroupKind sns.services.k8s.aws/Topic . If you would like to use a differently-named Kubernetes Role than the defaults, you are welcome to do so by modifying the Kubernetes manifests that are used as part of the installation process. Once the Kubernetes Role objects have been created, you will want to assign specific a Kubernetes User to a particular Role . You do this using the typical Kubernetes RoleBinding object. For example, assume you want to have the Kubernetes User named \"Alice\" have the ability to create, read, delete and modify CRs that ACK service controllers manage in the Kubernetes \"default\" Namespace , you would create a RoleBinding that looked like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind : RoleBinding metadata : name : ack.user namespace : default subjects : - kind : User name : Alice apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io roleRef : kind : Role name : ack.user apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io Configuring AWS IAM \u00b6 Since ACK service controllers bridge the Kubernetes and AWS API worlds, in addition to configuring Kubernetes RBAC permissions, you will need to ensure that all AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and permissions have been properly created.
